# forest_fire_classification
Used machine learning classification to analyze the initial spread index of forest fire. 
Specifically, logistic regression and kernel Support Vector Machines (SVM) were implemented to find the relationship of ISI code against some other features, including FFMC, DMC, and DC, and come up with a trained model to predict the ISI code based on these features.

Forest fire data set from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Forest+Fires was selected as database
